Olivetti
========

Olivetti is a simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

Features
--------

- set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins
  to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window
- text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
  fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0)
- optionally hide the modeline for distraction-free writing

Olivetti actually duplicates a subset of features already present in
[Writeroom-mode][], but Olivetti keeps all features buffer-local.

Requirements
------------

- Emacs 24.1 (not tested on earlier versions, only tested on Mac OS X
  and Linux, not tested on Windows).

Installation
------------

Olivetti is available through [MELPA][] and [MELPA-stable][]. I
encourage installing the stable version.
